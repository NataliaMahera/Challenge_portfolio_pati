# Task 1: Software configuration

## Subtask 1: Why did I choose to participate in the Dare IT Challenge?

Hello, my name is Natali. At first, I decided to participate in this project because such a program is a great motivation
to start taking first steps in my career plans, because I see myself in this industry.
Secondly, I know it is a chance to gain a lot of practical knowledge with a team of professionals and build my first portfolio.
Finally, the Dare IT Challenge will give me the opportunity to win a 2-month internship at well-known Polish companies.
